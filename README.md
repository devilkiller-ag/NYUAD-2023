# Smart Current: Blackouts are not just an inconvenience
https://smartcurrents.webflow.io/

## Goal

In this project, we leverage quantum computing to solve the problem of power outages. Quantum-enhanced GNNs and quantum extracted topological features are used to regulate power flows and prevent blackouts.
